This Homework consists in Making the turtlebot robot run around the rooms and follow the walls without hitting them. 

I have chosen to implement this homework in CPP code. The algorithms of my code is as follows:

1. Robot scans his middle distance, leftmost and rightmost distance. 
I put a threshold value for the middle distance as well as leftmost and rightmost distance.

2. If robots middle is smaller than threshold distance, robot has to do the following:

	- If left is bigger than right, it goes a little back and turns left.
	- If left is smaller than right, it goes a little back and turns right.

During these conditions, it also checks for nan conditions.

3. If the wall the robot is going towards is not straight but inclined it does the following:

	- If middle distance is bigger than threshold, it does the following:

		- If left is smaller than the other set threshold for left and right 			wall, it goes right without going back.
	
		- If right is smaller than other set threshold, it goes left without 			going back.

		- If none of these cases is correct, and middle distance continues 			being bigger than threshold, it keeps going straight.
